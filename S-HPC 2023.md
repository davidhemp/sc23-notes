Ryan Adamson - Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)

HPC systems are designed to meet peak performance and scalability goals but today’s security guidance and tools are designed for enterprise infosec. This means that it is quite difficult to secure HPC resources without impacting performance goals. In this talk, we will examine the key security differences between enterprise systems and the common features of HPC environments. We will also discuss a new HPC Security NIST publication (currently draft) and touch on how secure ‘open science’ research really needs to be. From there, we will explore emerging trends to keep track of such as scientific workflows that span multiple security domains and whether trusted computing and zero trust models can be adapted to HPC. Finally, we will demonstrate one example of a zero-day vulnerability found on a previous #1 top 500 system (disclosed and patched in 2018) to help motivate broader action to put an ‘S’ in HPC.
