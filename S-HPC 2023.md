## Distinguished Speaker: The ‘S’ in HPC Stands for Security
https://sc23.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=misc267&sess=sess429

Ryan Adamson - Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)

HPC systems are designed to meet peak performance and scalability goals but today’s security guidance and tools are designed for enterprise infosec. This means that it is quite difficult to secure HPC resources without impacting performance goals. In this talk, we will examine the key security differences between enterprise systems and the common features of HPC environments. We will also discuss a new HPC Security NIST publication (currently draft) and touch on how secure ‘open science’ research really needs to be. From there, we will explore emerging trends to keep track of such as scientific workflows that span multiple security domains and whether trusted computing and zero trust models can be adapted to HPC. Finally, we will demonstrate one example of a zero-day vulnerability found on a previous #1 top 500 system (disclosed and patched in 2018) to help motivate broader action to put an ‘S’ in HPC.

## Thoughts on Security for CXL-3.x-GFAM Clusters with Embedded Computing
https://sc23.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=misc269&sess=sess429

Craig Warner - Micron Technology Inc

Multi-host clusters built with CXL memory modules (enabled by the CXL 3.0 standard) provide a for an opportunity for power efficient computing. Enabling near data computing is not without it security challenges. This presentation identifies several security issues worthy of architectural considerations and approaches for mitigating these issues.

## Analyzing the Performance Impact of HPC Workloads with Gramine+SGX on 3rd Generation Xeon Scalable Processors
https://sc23.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=ws_shpc101&sess=sess429

Shinobu Miwa - University of Electro-Communications, Japan

Both 3rd generation Xeon scalable processors and Gramine 1.0, which potentially improves the performance of Intel SGX, were released in 2021. In this paper, we provide the first performance analysis of HPC workloads with Gramine and SGX on 3rd generation Xeon scalable processors. Our analysis starts with some microbenchmarks and is then extended to various HPC workloads. Our experimental results show that Gramine+SGX shows a small performance overhead (4-17%) for both compute-intensive and memory-bandwidth-sensitive workloads but a bit large performance overhead (up to 170%) for a memory-latency-sensitive workload. In addition, we show that the combination of Gramine and a 3rd generation Xeon scalable processor shows a slowdown of 1.5x on average (up to 4.4x) for many HPC workloads. This number is an order of magnitude smaller than that reported in the previous work using the combination of the former generation SGX toolchain and processor.
