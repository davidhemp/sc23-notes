# Talk from David Ellison on Generative AI
Using Llama 2 and Lenovo corp data to create a chatbot that can answer questions about Lenovo.
Normal comments about power and cooling.
Will we continue to see AI in more and more applications?
Almost half of the AI money this year went into Generative AI, otherwise the AI investment was down on the year before.
We should get David Ellison to talk to iX and see if that leads to anything.

# Ominiverse
Standardisation about L40S for inferance workloads, 2x CPUs, 4x GPUs, 4x NICs, 1x DPU.
"AI factories" instead of traditional HPC.
NVLink fabrics to connect nodes. Unclear how this lines up with memory fabrics and IB.

# Australia
This is mostly NDA but it is also stuff we have seen before. Expect public updates next year.

# Side note
Should hear about Barcelona soon.
