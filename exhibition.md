# Altiar
Spoke to them about job credits and how we could use it for express jobs. They recommend seeing up projects which can run in a seperate VM or the PBSPro server and it connected to the scheduler using supplied job hooks. 
They also mentioned this can be used for reporting back to the users/project owners who used what so they can see their consumption. This is something we have effectlively already paid for and Adarsh could help use with. They are going to get back to me and maybe if a presentation.

# Lenovo 
Ana mentioned that she spoke to Altair about jobs with short-term resource requirements, for example a job that needs a lot of memory at the start but it in theory could release it later on.
They are working together to see if they can get a POC out.

# Vast
Explore the idea of a small (200 TB or something) that could be used for development work. Maybe something connected to the iX work or DPUs. Vast already use DPUs in the system.

# Ohio state
A PhD student at Ohio state is using Bluefield v2 to optimise HPL using a custom library. They are able to see a 10% performance increase using their proposed method and would be interested in using it against any applications we have. They would also be interested in just running their code against the Bluefield v3 we are meant to be getting. 

# Alcesflight
Maybe they can be used to manage a Student cluster? Depends on value add compaired to other solutions.

Arm are claiming their new 144-core CPU is twice as fast as Intel Icelake. The most interesting thing here is they did it with a much lower power requirement. 
The next question would be complier support and if this performance is found in other applications. This should be noted they compared their new CPU to Intel and AMDs old CPUs so I wouldn't expect this performance advantage to hold but it is still interesting due to the reduced power consumption. 


As a general statement there are a number of Quantum stands so seems to be something the industry as a whole is pushing.
