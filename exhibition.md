# Altiar
Spoke to them about job credits and how we could use it for express jobs. They recommend seeing up projects which can run in a seperate VM or the PBSPro server and it connected to the scheduler using supplied job hooks. 
They also mentioned this can be used for reporting back to the users/project owners who used what so they can see their consumption. This is something we have effectlively already paid for and Adarsh could help use with. They are going to get back to me and maybe if a presentation.

# Lenovo 
Ana mentioned that she spoke to Altair about jobs with short-term resource requirements, for example a job that needs a lot of memory at the start but it in theory could release it later on.
They are working together to see if they can get a POC out.

# Vast
Explore the idea of a small (200 TB or something) that could be used for development work. Maybe something connected to the iX work or DPUs. Vast already use DPUs in the system.

As a general statement there are a number of Quantum stands so seems to be something the industry as a whole is pushing.
